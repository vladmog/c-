        : error found by the compiler
    cout
        : "character-output stream". Similar to JS's "console.log" and Python's "print"
    executable
        : What the computer extecutes, AKA "object code", "machine code".
    function
        : A named sequence of instructions for the computer to execute in the order in which they are written. Has four parts: returntype, name, parameter list, and function body.
    header
        : contains definitions of terms, such as "cout", that we use in our program
    IDE
        : "Integrated Development Environment"
    #include
        : directive that instructs the computer to make facilities available from a file
    library
        : a package of code that is meant to be re-used by many programs
    linker
        : The program that links object codes from different source codes "translation units", to
        form an executable program
    main()
        : function that tells the computer where to start executing
    object code
        : Machine-readable code. Usually  given suffix ".obj" in Windows, or ".o" in Unix.
    output
        : the result of processed input
    program
        : directions of "what to do" for a computer
    source code
        : What you read and write. Also called "program text". Usually given suffix ".cpp", or ".h"
    statement
        : basic unit controlling execution flow in a function

## Chapter 3: Object, Types, and Values

    >>
        : Input operation. "get from" operator.
    assignment
        : giving a variable a new value. Does not include type specification in words
    cin
        : standard input stream "character input". Defined in the standard library
    concatenation
        : combining of strings
    conversion
        : transferring a value from one type to another
    declaration
        : statement that gives a name to an object
    decrement
        : subtracting 1 from a variable
    definition
        : a declaration that sets aside memory for an object
    increment
        : adding 1 to a variable
    initialization
        : giving a variable its initial value. Always comes with a type specification
    name:
        title of the information being stored by a variable
    narrowing
        : putting a value into an object that may be too small ("narrow") to hold it.
    object
        : some memory that holds a value of a given type
    operation
        : something that can perform some action, such as a function and an operator
    operator
        : +, -, /, ==, %, +=, ++, etc.
    type
        : defines a set of possible values and a set of operations (for an object)
    type safety
        : when objects are used only according to the rules for their type
    value
        : set of bits in memory interpreted according to a type
    variable
        : named object
